# Guidance for retiring Delve in your organization

In December 2024 Delve will be retired. This was first announced in a MC Post available in the [Microsoft 365 Message Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC698136). There's also an article you can refer to, [Alternatives to Delve in Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/alternatives-to-delve-in-microsoft-365-59e29736-de90-40ce-93ee-0bbe23902a42), that focuses on helping end users find alternatives for their tasks within Microsoft 365. The purpose of this article is to assist administrators with the Delve offboarding process.

## What will be retired?

Delve offers many features that are built on top of multiple Microsoft 365 services. When we say we're retiring Delve, it's important to note that we're not changing or retiring anything on the services side. Both documents and people data that are surfaced in Delve will continue to be stored and managed as today.

There are a couple of exceptions to this. Delve stores a very limited set of Delve-specific data such as list of users recently viewed in Delve, Delve favorite documents, Delve favorite tags, and some Delve-specific settings. These will be retired together with Delve. You can export this data before December 16, 2024, in Delve by going to **Select Settings** > **Feature settings** > **Export data**.

## Where can users view user properties currently surfaced in Delve?

Starting December 2024, properties currently surfaced in Delve, including custom user-profile properties, will be added to the Profile cards that are available in search experiences on Microsoft365.com/Office.com and in SharePoint. Eventually, these changes will be enabled everywhere the Profile card is available. However, for technical reasons, this will take some time. For December 2024 we recommend directing users to Microsoft365.com/Office.com or SharePoint, which also offers a people search similar to what's offered in the Delve search.

## Direct links to profile cards

The modern search experiences on Microsoft365.com/Office.com and in SharePoint include profile pages built on the same data as profile cards. They have a unique link and can be used in documentation, email signatures, etc. We will handle redirects from Delve profiles to these profile pages on Microsoft365.com. Although there are three places and URLs that offer the same experience, we suggest you refer to the same domain as we use in the Microsoft365.com redirects.

### Example links

Microsoft365.com

Office.com

SharePoint
