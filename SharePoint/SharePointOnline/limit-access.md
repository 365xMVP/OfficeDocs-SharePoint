# Restrict OneDrive access by security group

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

You can restrict access and sharing of OneDrive content to users in specified Microsoft Entra ID security groups. Even if other users outside of these security groups are licensed for OneDrive, they wonâ€™t have access to their own OneDrive or any shared OneDrive content when this policy is in effect.

OneDrive access restriction is applied when a user attempts to open a OneDrive or access a file. Users not members of the specified security group can still see files in search results if they have existing direct permissions to the file, but they won't be able to access the file if they're not part of the security specified group

You can use this to prevent oversharing of OneDrive content. For example, you can restrict OneDrive access and sharing to your users, preventing guests from accessing any OneDrive content even if the content was previously shared with them.

## Requirements

To access and use this feature, your organization must have one of the following subscriptions:

- Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management
