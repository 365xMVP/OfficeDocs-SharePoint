# AI Insights for SharePoint Advanced Management

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

The Advanced AI Insights feature for [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md) uses the power of a customized language model to identify patterns and potential issues from reporting and receive actionable recommendations to solve any issues.

As an [IT administrator](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles), you can reduce the manual effort required to review reports during audits, and mitigate content governance issues with the Advanced AI Insights feature in [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219).

Key capabilities of Advanced AI Insights for SharePoint Advanced Management include:

- Automated analysis of reports and insights generated by SharePoint Advanced Management
- Detection of patterns and potential content governance issues, such as misapplied or missing labels and excessive permissions on site content
- Provision of practical recommendations for resolving these issues using the tools and strategies available in the SharePoint ecosystem
