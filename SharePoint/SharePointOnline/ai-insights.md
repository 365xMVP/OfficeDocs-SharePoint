# AI Insights for SharePoint Advanced Management

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

The AI Insights feature for [SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/sharepointonline/advanced-management) lets you leverage the power of a Large Language Model to identify patterns and potential issues from reporting and receive actionable recommendations to solve any issues.

As a [SharePoint administrator](/sharepoint/sharepointonline/sharepoint-admin-role), you can reduce the manual effort required to review reports during audits, and mitigate content governance issues from the Collaboration insights dashboard in [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219).

Key capabilities enabled by LLM within SharePoint Advanced Management include:

- Automated analysis of reports and insights generated by SharePoint Advanced
- Detection of patterns and potential content governance issues, such as misapplied or missing labels and excessive permissions on site content
- Provision of practical recommendations for resolving these issues using the tools and strategies available in the SharePoint ecosystem

You can find the **Get AI Insights** button alongside any downloadable report in the Collaboration Insights dashboard. When activated, this button employs LLM to extract patterns from the report and offer a list of potential actions.

> [!NOTE]
> You can generate up to five AI insights for each report, depending on the size of the report.

AI Insights is available for the following reports in the Collaboration insights dashboard:

|Reports | Description |
|-----|-----|
|Top collaborative users | Users with the most file interactions such as sharing, viewing, and editing|
|Top sites shared internally | Sites that are being shared with the most guests|
|Top OneDrive collaborative users | OneDrive users that are sharing the most files|
|Top sites shared internally | Sites that are being shared with the most people and groups|

> [!NOTE]
> AI insights are based on a partial set of data, not the report as a whole. If you choose to generate another insight, the data will be based on the next set of data of the report.
