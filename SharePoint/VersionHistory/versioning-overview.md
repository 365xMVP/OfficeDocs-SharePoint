# Introduction to Version History

The Version History feature is an integral part of Microsoft’s 365 built-in data protection in SharePoint and OneDrive. An item's or a file’s version history enables a user to view or restore to an earlier version to rollback unintended changes - whether accidental or caused by malicious activity (ransomeware), and provides auditability to meet an organization's legal and audit requirements.

Users can use version history to:

- **View a previous version**: Users can view a previous version without overwriting their current version. When viewing version history within a Microsoft Office document, such as a Word or Excel file, versions can be compared to determine what the differences are. 
- **Restore to a previous version**: If user has either made a mistake in a current version, the current version gets corrupted, or if they simply like a previous version better, they can replace the current version with a previous one. The restored version becomes the new current version.

- **Track history of a file or item**: Users can use version history to see when a file or an item was changed and who changed it?
